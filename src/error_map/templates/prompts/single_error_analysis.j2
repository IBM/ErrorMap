You are an expert analyst. Your job is to evaluate evidence step by step, consider alternatives, and reach a justified conclusion. Reasoning: high.

You are given the following:
- A context
- A model response that was labeled incorrect
{% if correct_answer %}
- A reference
{% endif %}
{% if correct_outputs %}
- A list of solutions that were labeled as correct
{% endif %}

Your task:

1. Structured Correct Solution: Analyze the correct responses and extract from them the main required criteria or reasoning steps for the context.

2. Step-by-step Evaluation: Evaluate the incorrect response against each of the required criteria. For each criterion, provide the following fields:
present_in_wrong: Whether it is present in the incorrect response
quality: The quality of its execution (correct, partially correct, incorrect, or null if missing)
evidence: Supporting evidence from the incorrect response (quote)
comment: Any relevant comments

3. Error Diagnosis: Identify the first major error in the incorrect response that led to the incorrect answer, and provide the following fields in final_answer:
error_summary: If such an error exists, summarize the model's reasoning weakness in error_summary. This should focus on model thinking (e.g., 'the model failed to recognize fact X') rather than technical execution (e.g., 'the model selected the wrong answer').
title: Provide a short, free-form title that describes the specific type of error.
* If you didn't find any error in the incorrect response leave all the fields of final_answer with an empty string.
* If the whole solution is incorrect, write 'whole solution incorrect' in final_answer fields.
* Avoid ambiguous titles or ones that cannot be mapped to a specific skill. For example, instead of using "Wrong multiple choice selection", identify the underlying reasoning error such as "Misinterpretation of concept".

Use as many steps and thinking process as you need. Finally, output the final result in the following format:
{
  "required_criteria": [
    {
      "criterion": "Describe the relationship between A and B",
      "present_in_wrong": true,
      "quality": "incorrect",
      "evidence": "Because A increased when B increased, A must be caused by B.",
      "comment": "Confuses correlation with causation"
    },
    {
      "criterion": "Explain the mechanism of action",
      "present_in_wrong": true,
      "quality": "correct",
      "evidence": "the biochemical pathway...",
      "comment": "Accurate and complete"
    }
  ],
  "final_answer": {
    "error_summary": "The incorrect response assumes causation from correlation, leading to a flawed conclusion about the relationship between A and B.",
    "error_title": "Causal Misinterpretation"
  }
}


Use the following inputs:

Context:
{{ input_text }}

{% if correct_answer %}
References:
{{ correct_answer }}
{% endif %}

{% if correct_outputs %}
Correct Responses:
{{ correct_outputs }}
{% endif %}

incorrect prediction:
{{ output_text }}

Keeping the evaluation criteria in mind, do not provide a general assessment. Be specific, structured, and evidence-based.
