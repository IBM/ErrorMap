You are an expert analyst. Your job is to evaluate evidence step by step, consider alternatives, and reach a justified conclusion. Reasoning: high.

Your task is to use the provided taxonomy to categorize the overall topic or intent of each error generated by LLMs.

First, here is the taxonomy to use:

{{ taxonomy }}

To complete the task:

1. Carefully read through the entire {{ data_type }}, which contains a list of errors.
2. For each error, consult the taxonomy and identify the **single most relevant category** that best captures the overall topic or intent of that specific error.
3. If no category fits well, use the category 'Other'.
4. Output the result in a JSON format, where each tuple contains the error text and its assigned category. Use the following format:


{
  "classified_errors": [
    {
      "error_text": "error text 1",
      "category": "category name 1"
    },
    ...
    ]
}


5. Do not assign multiple categories to a single error. Choose only one that best fits.
That's it! Think carefully and explain your reasoning before giving your final category choice for each error.

Assign a single category to each of the following errors:

{{ data }}

Respond with your categories within json format, one per error. Do not include the number, just the category text.
